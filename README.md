# Ideas for codefundo++
The main objective of this project is to build soltions that will help predict and manage natural disasters.Predicting when a natural disaster will occur will certainly help save lives.The additional benefit to predicting natural disasters is that we can minimize the damage that would occur due to the disaster.
The solution works by analyzing datasets describing when and where natural disasters have occurred in the past 50 years.The datasets are presented graphically for easier understanding.
Dataset that will be used is from National Disaster Management Authority,the body primarily responsible for managing natural disasters in India.
Python (numpy,pandas,etc) will primarily be used to build the solution.
